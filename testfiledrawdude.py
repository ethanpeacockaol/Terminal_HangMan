yo, so see that up there we need to animate based off of incorrect or correct guesses that dude right

we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 placements being

his head []
his torso |
his left arm /
his right arm \
his penis |
his left leg /
his right leg \ 

right? so we need to just basically we can write it as a single string with spaces and \ns, we can store 7 strings in a list
every incorrect guess iterates the animationaled hangman to the next node to the right this will give the appearance of drawing him from his 
head torso leftarm right arm huge dick left leg and right leg sequentially right?

we also need a string that is just the stand to hang him from right?
so whoops we need 8 strings

okay that should be pretty easy lets save these notes and add it to the game file next
